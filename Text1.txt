Cloning an Existing Repository
If you want to get a copy of an existing Git repository — for example, a project you’d like to
contribute to — the command you need is git clone. If you’re familiar with other VCSs such as
Subversion, you’ll notice that the command is "clone" and not "checkout". This is an important
distinction — instead of getting just a working copy, Git receives a full copy of nearly all data that
the server has. Every version of every file for the history of the project is pulled down by default
when you run git clone. In fact, if your server disk gets corrupted, you can often use nearly any of
the clones on any client to set the server back to the state it was in when it was cloned (you may
lose some server-side hooks and such, but all the versioned data would be there — see Getting Git
on a Server for more details).
